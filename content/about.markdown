About Me
========

I was born in London UK, grew up in London ON, Canada, and now currently reside in West Hartford CT, USA.  However, I spend most of my time in Waterloo ON, since I'm a third-year student in the Software Engineering program at the University of Waterloo.  Despite my connections to the UK and USA, I hold only Canadian citizenship.

I'm a native speaker of English and Chinese (Cantonese), but I prefer English.  I've taken lessons in French, Spanish, Japanese, and Mandarin, but it's been many years, and I'm lucky to remember a few words from each.

Some of my hobbies include music, cooking, karate, trivia, and reading.  I took piano lessons for about ten years, and have been playing the violin for about four years now.  For trivia, I did [Reach for the Top][] in high school (we won nationals in 2009), and I'm now a member of (and webmaster for) the [UW Quiz Bowl Club][].  Regrettably, I no longer have the time for karate or the violin; every time I think about these, I wonder how things would have turned out had I made the time for them.

About This Site
===============
I originally used [WordPress][] in early 2010 to manage my site. It was quick and easy, simple, and had all the features I'd care to think about.  However, for some time, I had been considering rewriting my site from scratch.  WordPress is useful and nice, but setting it up isn't very impressive, and I wasn't learning anything.  It would be far more useful (as a learning experience) to write my own content management system.

This was meant to be a long-term project, but the (temporary) demise of the class server in fall 2010 changed my plans slightly.  My site was offline and I needed to put it back online somewhere.  I decided to use some from the [Computer Science Club][]'s server.

I decided that since I was changing hosts and had to restore a backup, I might as well start with a fresh new site.  And this is the site. Credits for the design go to my sister, [Ming-Cee][], who's an aspiring web designer (among many other things).  This is actually the second design; it's much crisper than the original design I used.

In late 2011, not too long after applying the new design, I finally got around to getting a domain name and a VPS.  I figured I might as well learn some new things, and I'd probably need the server for some personal projects.  Besides, it's about time I moved to somewhere a bit more permanent.

In early 2012, I finally abandoned the hand-coded site I had been maintaining.  I'm now using [nanoc][], a static site generator, to create my site. If you're interested in reading about the migration, I [blogged][] about it.
