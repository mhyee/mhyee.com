title: Fourth-Year Design Project
---

Overview
========

_The views expressed on this page and on my blog are my own; I do not speak on
behalf of my group._

The fourth-year design project (FYDP) is a mandatory three-course sequence in
the [software engineering][softeng] program at the [University of Waterloo][uw].
It spans twenty months, and is to be completed in groups of four undergraduate
students.

My group is working under the supervision of Professor [Derek Rayside][rayside]
to optimize the guided improvement algorithm, which is used to solve exact,
discrete, multi-objective optimization problems.

I have a series of blog posts explaining the background for our project, as well
as describing the work we have been doing.
