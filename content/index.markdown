Welcome!
========

Hello and welcome to my little corner of the web!

My name is Ming-Ho, and I'm currently a [software engineering][] student at the [University of Waterloo][], in Canada.  This site serves as a place for me to show some of my work and talk about interesting things that are going on in my life, or simply things I think are interesting.

Overdue blog post, since I was hoping to blog more frequently. As something different, I blog in a stream-of-consciousness manner about a nontechnical topic, [cooking][]!
