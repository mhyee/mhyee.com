Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my little corner of the web!

My name is Ming-Ho, and I'm currently a [software engineering][] student at the
[University of Waterloo][], in Canada.  This site serves as a place for me to
show some of my work and talk about interesting things that are going on in my
life, or simply things I think are interesting.

_"Our fourth-year design project is to optimize the guided improvement
algorithm, which is used to solve exact, discrete, multi-objective optimization
problems."_

One way to make the guided improvement algorithm run faster is to simply run
multiple instances in parallel. This approach, called the _overlapping guided
improvement algorithm_, is the subject of the [fourth post](/blog/fydp4.html) of
my blog series.
