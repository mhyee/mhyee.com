Welcome!
========

Hello and welcome to my little corner of the web!

My name is Ming-Ho, and I'm currently a [software engineering][] student at the [University of Waterloo][], in Canada.  This site serves as a place for me to show some of my work and talk about interesting things that are going on in my life, or simply things I think are interesting.

Back in January, I moved my site over to [nanoc][], a static site generator. And now I finally [blogged][] about it!
