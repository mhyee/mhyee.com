# Hello World!

I recently defended my Ph.D. in [computer science][khoury] at [Northeastern
University][], advised by [Arjun Guha][aguha] in the [Programming Research
Laboratory][].

My research interests include programming language design and implementation,
program analysis, and the intersection of machine learning and programming
languages.

I received my master's in [computer science][scs] at the [University of
Waterloo][], advised by [Ondřej Lhoták][olhotak] in the [Programming Languages Group];
and my bachelor's in [software engineering][se], also at the [University of
Waterloo][], where I worked with [Derek Rayside][drayside].

My hobbies and interests include listening to classical music and going to the
symphony; watching and discussing basketball, movies, and TV; tinkering with my
keyboards, dotfiles, and server; and enjoying tea.
