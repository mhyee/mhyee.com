Hello World!
============

My name is Ming-Ho Yee. I'm currently a Ph.D. student in [computer
science][khoury] at [Northeastern University][neu] in Boston, Massachusetts.
I work on [programming language][prl] design and implementation and software
engineering with [Arjun Guha][].

You can find my resume [here][PDF resume], as well as versions in [HTML][HTML
resume], [text][TXT resume], and [LaTeX][TEX resume]. I use a [script][resume
code] to generate my resume.

I'm also on [GitHub][], [Twitter][], and [LinkedIn][]. My email address is
`mh[AT][this domain]`.

Before my Ph.D., I was a master's student in the [School of Computer
Science][uwcs] at the [University of Waterloo][] in Canada, supervised by
[Ond&#345;ej Lhot&aacute;k][olhotak]. I also studied [programming languages][plg]
at Waterloo.

My undergraduate degree was in [software engineering][], also at Waterloo.
During that time, I held a variety of internships, from a small web development
startup to a large software corporation, from telecommunications to research.

My hobbies include listening to classical music, cooking, and reading. I also
like trivia: I played [Reach for the Top][] for my high school, and I now play
quizbowl. In the past, I played the piano and violin, and practiced karate.
