# Hello World!

I'm a research scientist at [Meta][], in Menlo Park, California. I work on the
runtime software for the [Meta Training and Inference Accelerator][mtia].

I received my Ph.D. in [computer science][khoury] at [Northeastern
University][], advised by [Arjun Guha][aguha] in the [Programming Research
Laboratory][]; my master's in [computer science][scs] at the [University of
Waterloo][], advised by [Ondřej Lhoták][olhotak] in the [Programming Languages
Group][]; and my bachelor's in [software engineering][se], also at the
[University of Waterloo][], where I worked with [Derek Rayside][drayside].

My technical interests include programming language design and implementation,
program analysis, and the intersection of machine learning and programming
languages.

My hobbies include listening to classical music and going to the symphony;
watching and discussing basketball, movies, and TV; tinkering with my keyboards,
dotfiles, and server; and enjoying tea and coffee.
