Hello World!
============

My name is Ming-Ho Yee. I'm currently a master's student in [computer science][]
at the [University of Waterloo][] in Canada, supervised by [Ond&#345;ej
Lhot&aacute;k][olhotak]. My research interests are static program analysis,
compilers, and [programming languages][plg].

You can find my resume [here][PDF resume], as well as versions in [HTML][HTML
resume], [text][TXT resume], and [LaTeX][TEX resume]. I use a [script][resume
code] to generate my resume.

I'm also on [GitHub][], [Twitter][], and [LinkedIn][]. My email address is
`mh[AT][this domain]`.

As an undergraduate student, I studied [software engineering][], also at
Waterloo. During that time, I held a variety of internships, from a small web
development startup to a large software corporation, from telecommunications to
research.

My hobbies include listening to classical music, cooking, and reading. I also
like trivia: I played [Reach for the Top][] for my high school, and I now play
[quizbowl][] for the University of Waterloo. In the past, I played the piano and
violin, and practiced karate.

About this site
---------------

Previous incarnations of this site existed as a WordPress blog and
hand-maintained static HTML pages.

Since 2012, I have been using [nanoc][], a static site generator. The design was
created by my sister, [Ming-Cee Yee][].
