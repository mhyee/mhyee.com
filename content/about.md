About Me
========

I am currently a fourth-year <a href="http://www.softeng.uwaterloo.ca">software
engineering</a> student at the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca">University of
Waterloo</a>. I have had a wide variety of internships, from a small web
development startup to a large software corporation, from telecommunications to
research.

My technical interests are in compilers and programming languages, algorithms,
and computer architecture. I am most comfortable writing code in C/C++, Java,
and Ruby, and I have some experience with C# and Perl.

Some of my hobbies include listening to music, cooking, reading, and trivia.
I was a member of my high school's <a href="http://www.reachforthetop.com">Reach
for the Top</a> team, and am now a member of Waterloo's
<a href="http://quizbowl.uwaterloo.ca">Quiz Bowl Club</a>. In the past, I played
the piano and violin, and practiced karate.
